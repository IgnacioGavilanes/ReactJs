## Navigation

In the navbar you can see some basic navigation links like home, low top (to search for all low top sneakers) and high top. 

Once you click on an item you will go to that particular item's detail, where you will be able to see its availability and price, and where you will also be able to add into your cart.

After you add that item to your cart, you will have the option to keep browsing or go to your cart. If you decide to go to your cart, there you will be able to visualize a detail of the items in your cart as well as see the final price of your order. There you will be able to remove one or all items. You will also be able to go to your payment method to finalize your purchase. 

After you decide to go to your payment method you will enter your contact information and once you submit it, your purchase will be completed and you will be taken into the homepage, thus completing the navigation.
